== docs

This directory contains documentation for the F Prime Prime (FPP)
FSW modeling language.
To generate the documentation, you need the following tools installed on your 
system:

* https://github.com/bocchino/redo[redo]

* https://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor]

Once you have these tools installed, you can run `redo` in this directory
to regenerate the HTML files from the AsciiDoc source files.


== Adding Keywords to FPP Specification
. To add a new FPP keyword, first update the Lexical Elements section of the FPP spec. 
. Next, update the `doc/code-prettify/run_prettify.js` file so it includes the new keyword. 
. Doing this will add highlight the keyword in the FPP spec.
. Finally, update `editors/emacs/fpp-mode.el` and `editors/vim/fpp.vim` so the emacs and vim
editors syntax highlighting for the new keyword.
