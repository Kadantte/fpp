== docs

This directory contains documentation for the F Prime Prime (FPP)
FSW modeling language.
To generate the documentation, you need the following tools installed on your 
system:

* https://github.com/bocchino/redo[redo]

* https://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor]

Once you have these tools installed, you can run `redo` in this directory
to regenerate the HTML files from the AsciiDoc source files.
