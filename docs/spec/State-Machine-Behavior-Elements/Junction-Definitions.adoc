=== Junction Definitions

A *junction definition* specifies a junction as part of a
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions,state machine definition>>
or
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Definitions,state definition>>.
A junction is a branch point controlled by a
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Guard-Definitions,guard>>.

==== Syntax

`junction` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`{`
`if` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>> <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Transition-Expressions,_transition-expression_>>
`else` <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Transition-Expressions,_transition-expression_>>
`}`

==== Static Semantics

. The identifier after the keyword `junction` is the name of the junction. 

. The identifier after the keyword `if` must
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions_Static-Semantics_Scoping-of-Names,refer>>
to a
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Guard-Definitions,guard definition>>.
It specifies the guard that controls the branch.

. Each of the transition expressions must be valid.
The first transition expression is run if the guard evaluates to `true`;
otherwise the second transition expression is run.

==== Dynamic Semantics

Each junction _J_ has the following *entry behavior*:

. Evaluate the guard of _J_.

. If _J_ evaluates to `true`, then
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Transition-Expressions_Dynamic-Semantics,
run the `if` transition expression in the context of _J_>>.

. Otherwise run the `else` transition expression in the context of _J_.

If any of the guard or the transition expressions requires a typed argument
_v_, then according to the static semantics, _v_ must be available,
and it must have a compatible type.
Use _v_ to evaluate the guard or run the transition expression.
