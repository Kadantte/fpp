=== Junction Definitions

A *junction definition* specifies a junction as part of a
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions,state machine definition>>
or
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Definitions,state definition>>.
A junction is a branch point controlled by a
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Guard-Definitions,guard>>.

==== Syntax

`junction` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`{`
`if` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>> <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Enter-Expressions,_enter-expression_>>
`else` <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Enter-Expressions,_enter-expression_>>
`}`

==== Semantics

. The identifier after the keyword `junction` is the name of the junction. 

. The identifier after the keyword `if` must
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions_Scoping-of-Names,refer>>
to a
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Guard-Definitions,guard definition>>.
It specifies the guard that controls the branch.

. Each of the enter expressions must be valid.
The first enter expression is run if the guard evaluates to `true`;
otherwise the second enter expression is run.

==== Examples

state machine Device {

  action initPower
  guard coldStart

  initial enter J1

  junction J1 {
    if coldStart enter OFF \
    else do initPower enter ON
  }

  state OFF

  state ON
