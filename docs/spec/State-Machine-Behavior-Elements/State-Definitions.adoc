=== State Definitions

A *state definition* is part of a 
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions,state machine definition>>
or
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Definitions,state definition>>.
It defines a state of a state machine.
A state _S'_ defined inside a state _S_ expresses a hierarchy
of states: _S'_ is a substate of _S_.

==== Syntax

`state` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_ `{` _state-definition-member-sequence_ `}` _]_

_state-definition-member-sequence_ is an 
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in
which each element is a *state definition member*,
and the terminating punctuation is a semicolon.
A state definition member is one of the following:

* An <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Initial-Transition-Specifiers,initial transition specifier>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Junction-Definitions,junction definition>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Definitions,state definition>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Transition-Specifiers,state transition specifier>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Entry-Specifiers,state entry specifier>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Exit-Specifiers,state exit specifier>>

==== Static Semantics

. The identifier is the name of the state.

. If the state definition member sequence _M_ is present,
then it must obey the following rules:

.. If _M_ contains at least one state definition, then _M_ must contain exactly
one initial transition specifier _I_.
_I_ specifies the sub-state to enter on entry to the outer state.

.. _M_ may not contain more than one state entry specifier.
If _M_ has a state entry specifier _S_, then the *entry actions* of
_M_ are the actions specified in _S_, in the order specified.
Otherwise _M_ has no entry actions.

.. _M_ may not contain more than one state exit specifier.
If _M_ has a state exit specifier _S_, then the *exit actions* of
_M_ are the actions specified in _S_, in the order specified.
Otherwise _M_ has no exit actions.

.. No two <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Transition-Specifiers,state
transition specifiers>> that are members of _M_ may
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions_Static-Semantics_Scoping-of-Names,refer>> to the same
signal definition.

. If the state definition member sequence _M_ is present and _M_
contains at least one state definition, then the
state definition is called an *inner state definition*.
Otherwise it is called a *leaf state definition*.

==== Dynamic Semantics

Each state definition _S_ has the following *entry behavior*:

. Run the entry actions, if any, of _S_.
According to the static semantics, the entry actions must
not require a typed argument.

. If _S_ is an inner state, then run the
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Initial-Transition-Specifiers_Dynamic-Semantics,
behavior>> of the initial transition of _S_.

. Otherwise set the current state of the state machine to _S_.
