=== Initial Transition Specifiers

An *initial transition specifier* is part of a
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions,state machine definition>>
or a
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Definitions,state definition>>.
It specifies an initial transition, i.e., a transition taken
when starting up a state machine or entering a state with
substates.

==== Syntax

`initial` 
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Enter-Expressions,_enter-expression_>>

==== Semantics

The state definition or junction definition referred to in the
enter expression must be a member of the same 
state machine definition or state definition in which the initial
transition specifier appears.

==== Examples
